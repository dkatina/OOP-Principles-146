# OOP Principles

#- Abstraction: Focus the what its doing and not how its doing it
#- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within a class and controlling access to them
#- Inheritance: Extending a parent class, and giving it additional functionality and characteristic
#- Polymorphism: Objects from differnt classes responding similarly to the same method 
#in their unique way.
